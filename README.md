## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azure-alerts-manager.git
cd azure-alerts-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your Azure credentials:
```bash
az login
```

4. Update the configuration:
Edit `alert_manager.py` and update your subscription ID and resource group:
```python
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_group_name = 'your-resource-group'

alert_names_to_modify = [
    'xxx-xxxx-xxx',
    'xxx xx xxx - xx-xx'
]
```

5. Run the script:
```bash
python alert_manager.py
```

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is

# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
